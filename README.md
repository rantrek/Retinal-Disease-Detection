# Retinal-Disease-Detection

## About the Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/retinal-disease-classification

## Objective

The purpose of this project:
1. Build a model that classifies between healthy and unhealthy retinas. (Binary classifier)
2. Build a model that further identifies the disease(s) amongst the images with unhealthy retinas. (Multi-label classifier)
3. Develop a web application that first predicts whether the retina is healthy or unhealthy and then if unhealthy, further identifies the disease(s), given a single image. 

## Program

The programs were developed in Python. The models were trained using Jupyter Notebook and run in Google Colab. The app is a single python file.
